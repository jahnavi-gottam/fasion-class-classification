Problem Statement

The dataset used in this project consists of 70,000 grayscale images, divided into:

    * 60,000 training samples
    * 10,000 testing samples
Each image is 28x28 pixels (total of 784 pixels) and is associated with a label corresponding to one of 10 predefined fashion classes. The ultimate goal is to predict the label for new fashion items with high confidence and accuracy, enabling applications in e-commerce, inventory management, and personalized recommendations.

Fashion Classes

The dataset includes the following 10 categories:

    1.T-shirt/top
    2.Trouser
    3.Pullover
    4.Dress
    5.Coat
    6.Sandal
    7.Shirt
    8.Sneaker
    9.Bag
    10.Ankle boot
Key Features of the Dataset

    * Image Format: Grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels.
    * Class Labels: Single class label associated with each image.
    * Pixel Values: Each pixel value ranges from 0 to 255, representing the grayscale intensity.
Business Applications

1) Automating product categorization in e-commerce platforms.
2) Enhancing inventory management by identifying items via images.
3) Improving customer experience through personalized fashion recommendations.

Steps to Build the Model

1. Data Preparation
    * Load and preprocess the dataset.
    * Normalize pixel values to a range between 0 and 1 for better model performance.
    * Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.

2. Model Architecture

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented for classification:

    * Input Layer: Accepts 28x28 grayscale images.
    * Convolutional Layers: Extract spatial features using kernels.
    * Pooling Layers: Down-sample feature maps to reduce overfitting.
    * Fully Connected Layers: Classify images into one of the 10 categories.
    * Activation Function: ReLU for intermediate layers and Softmax for the output layer.

3. Evaluation Metrics
The model is evaluated using:

* Accuracy: Percentage of correctly classified images.
* Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Evaluated for each class.
* Confusion Matrix: To identify misclassifications.

Project Results
The final model demonstrates the following:

High accuracy on the test dataset.
Effective classification of the 10 fashion categories.
Insights into potential areas for improvement through visualization and misclassification analysis.
